## ‚ùó Problem Statement

Financial institutions deal with thousands of loan applications monthly, making it difficult to track the quality, approval status, and performance of loans efficiently. Traditional tabular reports are often static and do not provide actionable insights. The absence of a centralized, interactive system limits the ability to:

- Quickly assess high-risk vs low-risk loans.
- Identify the most common reasons for loan applications.
- Understand funding trends and applicant characteristics.
- Make timely, data-driven decisions to improve business performance.

## üéØ Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build an **interactive Excel dashboard** that:

- Visualizes overall loan performance (good vs bad loans).
- Highlights monthly application trends.
- Analyzes loan purposes, interest rates, and repayment terms.
- Segments data by state, employment length, and other demographic variables.
- Empowers financial analysts and managers with clear, actionable insights to improve loan approval strategies and reduce default rates.
